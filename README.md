Website with Stock Data, Historical Analysis and Predictions



O B J E C T I V E S :

Our project aims to provide insights into stock market analysis and prediction.
The data: a decades worth of historical stock data for ten major companies
Some included metrics: prices, volume, and change percentage 

By utilizing machine learning, our team is able to provide the user with predicted closing prices

The Companies: Apple, AMD, Amazon, Cisco, Qualcomm, Meta, Microsoft, Netflix, Starbucks, Tesla

P R O C E S S :

Prior to modeling, we cleaned normalized, and standardized our data.  We then utilized a Python script to initialize, tran and evaluate our models. Our group performed model optimization techniques to evaluate our model's performance to be displayed within our script. Two machine learning techniques were used - Linear Regression and LSTM. 

L I M I T A T I O N S : 

Stock prices are difficult to predict. There are many outside factors that can affect stock prices. Our dataset also had a limited number of features.

C O N C L U S I O N : 

Machine learning prediction models shouldnâ€™t be too close to 100% accurate - this would indicate an error in our model due to overfitting.

Stock prices are volatile and if people and/or technology were able to successfully predict them, they would have. Historical data can be used to attempt an accurate model, but in the end something as unpredictable and small as a news story can completely transform the stock market, so complete accuracy is impossible.
